    <p>The character database is a web application designed to assist writers,
      game developers, managers, and more. It provides a simple organization system for profiles of
      characters or people. The Add section allows you to create a new profile with basic information
      about a character, such as name, occupation, and a custom biography. Writers will also appreciate
      the custom personality attributes, which allow you to visualize specific aspects of your characters'
      personalities on a scale between two extremes. The database also includes a search function
      that searches characters' names, roles, and biographies.</p>
